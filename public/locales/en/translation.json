It is believed that coffee was introduced in 1727 in Brazil, when a sergeant smuggled coffee seeds from French Guiana to Brazil. Initially, its cultivation was restricted to a few areas, but it soon spread, becoming the country's main crop and source of wealth."

      "text": "Coffee production in Brazil has gone through several phases over the years, boosting the Brazilian economy at first. However, the over-reliance on coffee as the main export product brought challenges, especially during the coffee crisis in the 20th century. This led Brazil to diversify its economy and explore other sectors. From 2022-2023 coffee production increased 6%. In recent years, Conilon has increased its share of world coffee production, generating an increase in Brazil's share of world production. The tendency is for the production of arabica and Conilon coffee to be equal."

In second place is Vietnam, contributing nearly 20% of the total production, reflecting the significant growth of coffee cultivation in this country. Arabica coffee continues to be the predominant type, accounting for 55% of global production, recognized for its superior quality and refined aroma. On the other hand, Robusta coffee accounts for 45% of production, valued for its disease resistance and higher caffeine content. The two largest destinations for Brazilian coffee are the United States and Europe, together absorbing approximately 42% of the country's exports."

In 1770 coffee was brought to Rio de Janeiro. The cultivation of coffee plantations in Espírito Santo occurred in the middle of the 19th century. The existence of the Port of Vitória further benefited the economic development of coffee in Espírito Santo. The first Conilon seeds were planted in the municipality of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim."

      "text": "Espírito Santo experienced a major coffee boom at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, adapting well to the state's climatic and geographical conditions. However, as a result of the intensification of price crises, coffee farming went through severe adversities in the 1950s and 1960s. The federal policy of eradicating coffee plantations, which aimed to diversify the Espírito Santo economy and control prices through the elimination of 1 billions of coffee prices, directly affected the Espírito Santo economy and exposed its strong dependence on monoculture of this agricultural product, leading to a decline in production and the need for economic diversification"

Coffee cultivation began to expand in the late 19th century, thriving under the favorable climatic and geographical conditions of the state. Espírito Santo quickly emerged as one of Brazil's leading coffee producers, driving the local economy and attracting investments to the region. Over the years, the quality of Capixaba coffees has stood out in both the national and international markets, earning awards and recognition for their excellence."

Additionally, the annual production ranges from 8.5 to 9.5 million bags per year, demonstrating the strength and significant impact that coffee has on the local economy."
